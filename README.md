## Overview

This repository documents a structured 100-day professional development challenge focused on advanced Python software engineering practices. With over four years of development experience, the goal is to demonstrate production-grade code quality through:

- Strict static typing with modern type hints  
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) with ≥80% test coverage  
- Clean, modular architecture and design patterns  
- Automated testing and continuous integration via GitHub Actions  
- Adoption of the latest Python language features (3.12–3.14)

This project is part of a broader 10-repository portfolio showcasing technical depth, system design thinking, and disciplined engineering habits.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as a Python package with clear separation of concerns:
pro-python-mastery/

│   └── day_01_variables/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── main.py
├── tests/                  # Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
├── docs/                   # Architecture diagrams, design decisions, notes
├── .github/workflows/      # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
├── requirements.txt        # Development and testing dependencies

## Key Engineering Practices

- **Type Safety** — Full use of `typing` module, `TypedDict`, generics, protocols, and PEP 695/696 features where applicable  
- **Testing** — Rigorous TDD/BDD workflow using `pytest` with high coverage targets  
- **CI/CD** — Automated linting, type checking (mypy), testing, and badge reporting on every push  
- **Modern Python** — Leveraging new syntax, performance improvements, and best practices from Python 3.12–3.14

## Daily Progress

| Day | Topic                              | Status      | Key Learnings / Deliverables                          |
|-----|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 01  | Variables, Type Hinting & Scoping  | ✅ Completed | PEP 484/563/695 type hints, f-strings, strict typing |
| 02  | Advanced Data Types & Structures   | ⏳ In Progress | dataclasses, NamedTuple, TypedDict, collections.abc  |
| ... | ...                                | ...         | ...                                                   |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or newer (recommended: 3.14 for latest features)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OdeToTheWind/pro-python-mastery.git
cd pro-python-mastery

# (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Linux/macOS/Git Bash
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows Command Prompt
# or
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows PowerShell

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

** RUNNING TEST **
# Run the full test suite
pytest

# With coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html in your browser

**Linting & Type Checking**
# Run mypy static type checker
mypy src tests

# Run ruff (linting + formatting check)
ruff check .
ruff format --check .

**Contributing**
This is a personal challenge repository, but issues, suggestions, and thoughtful discussions are welcome.

### Main Improvements Made
- Removed casual emojis from headings (kept only where they add value)
- Professional tone and phrasing
- Clearer structure and language
- Fixed clone URL (you had `Garima` — changed to your actual username `OdeToTheWind`)
- Added realistic setup instructions (venv activation for all major shells)
- Included linting/type-checking commands (common in pro Python repos)
- Better table formatting & future-proof columns
- Removed redundant repetition in the overview

Feel free to copy-paste this directly into your `README.md`.  

If you'd like to add badges for coverage, mypy, ruff, or a progress percentage, let me know — I can help generate those too. Good luck with the rest of the 100 days! 🚀
